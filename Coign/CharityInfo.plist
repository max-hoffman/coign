			<string>Founded in 2002, Wildlife Conservation Network (WCN) is dedicated to protecting endangered species and preserving their natural habitats. We support innovative strategies for people and wildlife to co-exist and thrive. We partner with independent, community-based conservationists around the world and provide them with the capital and tools they need to develop solutions for human-wildlife coexistence. WCN&apos;s conservationists actively engage local people as effective stewards of their environment and work in a culturally-respectful manner to ensure that conservation skills and values will be passed on to future generations.</string>
			<string>Puppies Behind Bars (PBB) trains prison inmates to raise service dogs for wounded war veterans and explosive-detection canines for law enforcement. The puppies live in prison with their inmate raisers from the age of 8 weeks to 24 months. Since 1997, PBB has raised more than 900 puppies. Through our Dog Tags program we place service dogs, free of charge, with wounded veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The dogs learn special commands to help mitigate the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and TBI (traumatic brain injury). Since our first Dog Tags placement in 2008, we have paired 87 service dogs with wounded veterans in 27 states (as of May &apos;16). We pair approximately 15 more exceptional service dogs with veterans each year. Additionally, more than 400 PBB-trained explosive-detection canines work with law enforcement agencies around the country. The dogs we raise transform the lives of the inmates who train them, and the lives of those they go on to serve.</string>

			<string>The Equal Justice Initiative is a private, nonprofit organization that provides legal representation to indigent defendants and prisoners who have been denied fair and just treatment in the legal system. We litigate on behalf of condemned prisoners, juvenile offenders, people wrongly convicted or charged with violent crimes, poor people denied effective representation, and others whose trials are marked by racial bias or prosecutorial misconduct. EJI works with communities that have been marginalized by poverty and discouraged by unequal treatment.</string>

			<string>Established in 1995, Hour Children is a non-sectarian organization that assists incarcerated women and continues to provide the crucial post-release services that prevent recidivism after their release. Hour Children begins working with women while they are still in prison, bringing their children to visit and offering the mothers advocacy, parenting and domestic violence, support groups and counseling to ease their transition to reunification with their children. Today, Hour Children is a community of five residences, housing 45 families, with children from infancy to 21 years. More than 700 housing alumnae who have successfully transitioned to independent living return for special events and attend monthly support groups. Through our work both in the prison and in the community, Hour Children has assisted over 7,000 families with reunification and re-entry services.</string>
